<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Spokane Washington, attending a small private Catholic school for most of my childhood. After middle school, I decided to go to a public high school - Mead High School in North Spokane. Once graduated, I applied to Eastern Washington University to start in the nursing program. As I was going to school for nursing I was also working at Sacred Heart Hospital in Downtown Spokane - realizing nursing wasn't what I wanted to do, I switched majors. I thought Healthcare Administration seemed interesting, especially after working pretty low on the totum pole at the hospital as a Patient Transporter. Those classes didn't work out so I switched into Communications and Public Relations, minoring in Journalism. </p>
<p> I currently work at Holy Family Hospital in North Spokane in the Emergency Department as an ER Technician. With wound care, with casting and splinting, and with other Nursing Assistant like duties, I prepare for Physician Assistant School. They require a bachelors degree of your choice, and 2-4 thousand patient care hours in the ER. After graduating this spring I will enroll at the community college in Spokane to take six science classes required for the program while also working to gain more hours. I hope to accomplish these goals in order to become an amazing medical provider.</p>
